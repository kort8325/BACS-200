    <h2>Python, the simple language
    </h2>
    <p>     Work on python began in the late 1980's by Guido van Rossum, who had worked on google for a time.It became the main coding language used by the Netherlandsd, succeeding the ABC language and was notable because of it's ability of exception handling and interfacing, which would become a standard  for languages in the future.  <br>
        Today, Python 3.7 is the language that various software development developers default to, because of the simple coding of complex functions and methods.
