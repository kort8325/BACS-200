Project goals and plans:

Checkpoint 1:
5 page menus, I think it will be about Python lists.  6 pages going over linked lists, stacks, queues, deques, and hashlists

Checkpoint 2:
Made the graph on home page, and worked on css file.  I don't want to use bootstrap because it feels like it't not my work, 
and I believe i can make something original and professional without it. 

Checkpoint 3:
Sidenav menu added, along with css work on making the python stuff in the web pages.  A lot of work went into the python classes.

Checkpoint 4:
All python sectoins completed, along with table describing it all in terms of O(n) time of the methods.
